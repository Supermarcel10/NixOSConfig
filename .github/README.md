## üîß What is Nix / NixOS?

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager.<br/>
[Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) is a powerful package manager and system configuration tool.

Nix is:
- Declarative
- Reliable
- Reproducible
- Atomicly Versioned

## üõ†Ô∏è How Nix Works

Nix uses a functional approach to package management and system configuration:

1. Packages are built in isolation, meaning no dependencies are shared between them.
2. Each package version has a unique hash, allowing multiple versions of a package to coexist.
3. System configurations are defined in Nix expressions, describing the desired state.
4. Nix builds a new system configuration without affecting the current one.
5. The new configuration can be activated, and easily switched between configurations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `configuration.nix`: Main NixOS configuration file
- `secrets/`: Directory containing encrypted files used for storing secrets. [(private repo)](https://github.com/Supermarcel10/NixOSConfig-Secrets)
- TBD...
